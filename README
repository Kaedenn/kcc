kcc by Kaedenn

This program makes the daily life of a C, C++ or assembly programmer a tad
bit easier, by supplying quick, intuitive and friendly shortcuts to many of
gcc's facilities. Although this is far from a complete build system or a
replacement for Makefiles, kcc is meant for smaller programs with fewer
source files; it's not suited for large projects.

Although this program will run standalone with no non-standard utilities,
the magic of this program comes from the optional kaedenn.errmsg and
kaedenn.gcc modules. If supplied and with the proper configuration of
environment variables, compiler results from gcc will be printed in color,
allowing easier viewing of large sets of compiler errors.

For further information, invoke this program with the -h or --help option.
